## Hi, I'm Bobby!
This readme will serve two audiences- those who I work with at my day job, and those who come across it organically.  

üí¨  he/him  
üè¢  Senior Software Engineer @ NexHealth  
üïó  US/Eastern  

### Working Style  
I typically am available professionally from 9AM-5PM ET. Open source availability really depends on where I can fit it in to my schedule. If you need me outside of my normal availability, please let me know in advance so I can make accomodations.  

### Communication
I really try to embrace async communication where it makes sense to. I've been working remote in some capacity for around 5 years now, and it has really opened my eyes to the benefits of async communciation, especially when working across timezones. If you haven't read it, GitLab has a wonderful guide for [async communication](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/). It also helps me as an individual with ADHD, as synchronous and real-time communication can rip me out of focus and negatively impact my workflow. 
 
Sometimes, it makes sense to communicate synchronously, so if that's the case, put a meeting on my calendar if you'll need a chunk of time or a video call, otherwise feel free to instant message me. 

### Technologies
I am most frequently writing Ruby, however I absolutely love Elixir as well. I touch JavaScript when I have to. üòÜ  
While I'm not a devops person by title, I enjoy learning and contributing to CI/CD processes and optimizing time-to-run for things like test suites, Docker image builds, and deploys.
